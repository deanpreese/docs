1. What stands out about how they're using Mintlify?
2. What's the expansion opportunity? (be specific: AI Chat?)
3. Why do you think they haven't adopted this yet?
4. What would you need to learn to qualify if this is real?
5. What signals would indicate expansion readiness?

## What stands out in their usage

I looked at Coinbase.  I have used this documentation quite a bit over the years, but never looked at it through the lense of, "How could it be easier to use? And Better"

What stands out for me is the depth, shear volume of information and is it stays very well structured.

## Expansion opportunities 

With the volume of content, an AI Assistant would seem to be not only a huge improvement, but an easy win. 
     

## Why they may not have adopted this yet

Given the highly regulated nature of their business, there could be a few possibilities:

- They have to feel 100% certain that its not going to either provide incorrect information or create confusion.
- Resourcing and priorities    
- ROI

Any of these could nix a deal or project.

## What you’d need to learn to qualify if it’s real

To qualify each expansion opportunity, you would start with your analytics and metrics:

- How many monthly unique visitors and searches do their docs receive, and what are the top failure queries or high-bounce flows
- What percentage of support tickets relate to “how do I” questions that could be answered by docs or an assistant?

And what is the Coinbase company policy toward AI in customer-facing experiences, given the regulated nature of Coinbase, this is probably already known.
        

## Signals of expansion readiness

Signals that a given customer is ready for AI chat expansion:
- Ask them. They may thank you for asking. 
- High traffic and search volume, with noticeable content gaps or repeated queries that the Assistant can address. 
- Company buy-in.
- Bring up in QBRs or roadmap conversations.​

With Assistant, its an opportunity to rethink how they deliver documentation to their developers.
